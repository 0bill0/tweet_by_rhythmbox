tweet_by_rhythmbox
==================

A simple script to send status of the current song to twitter. I lost the whole day trying to configure a plugin rhytmbox gave up and did a few minutes this script. It would be much more practical if you did from the start.

 Requirements
=============
 - Python (http://www.python.org/) 2.6 Or 2.7
 - tweetpy (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/)
